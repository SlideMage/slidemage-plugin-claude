# Claude

Claude in SlideMage, in two ways. You choose which one SlideMage uses, and can switch at any time.

- **Claude Code, in a terminal.** SlideMage opens Claude Code, Anthropic's coding assistant, in a terminal beside the editor and connects it to
  the open deck. Claude Code reads and edits your slides with SlideMage's own tools, and stays inside what you are looking at: the
  **Slide / Deck** switch above the terminal says how far a request may reach. Parts of a slide that are protected (SlideMage's protected
  regions) are refused, whatever Claude Code tries. The terminal is the only thing this way does: SlideMage starts no hidden Claude Code runs
  of its own. Ask Claude there for what you need, for example "fix the LaTeX errors on this slide"; the task buttons type their prompts there
  (see below). AI requests of SlideMage's other features need the Anthropic API or a Local model, and say so on this route.
- **The Anthropic API.** SlideMage talks to Anthropic directly with your API key, with no Claude Code installed. The chat is SlideMage's own, with
  the same tools; the task buttons and other features that send a text to a model run on it. It needs nothing but the Python standard library.

**Task buttons on Claude Code.** The task buttons of a slide (translate, update a translation, fix LaTeX, proofread, make concise, better
title, speaker note, make readable, rewrite and proofread a selection) and of a deck (translate missing slides, update outdated translations, fix
LaTeX errors, summarise) type a ready prompt into Claude Code's input box. You read it, change it if you like, and send it with Enter yourself:
SlideMage never sends it, and one click is one prompt. A button for a deck is one prompt for the whole deck, which names the deck and what
to do, not a list of slides. If Claude Code is busy or its input box holds text, SlideMage says so and types nothing. Describing images and
translating their descriptions need the Anthropic API or a Local model.

**What leaves your computer.** With either way, the text of the slides you work on, the files and images your requests refer to, and
what you type go to Anthropic (`api.anthropic.com`). Claude Code makes its own further connections, as Anthropic describes for it; SlideMage does not
control them. The plugin sends nothing anywhere else. Your API key is kept in the system's keychain or in a file only you can read, never in a deck. SlideMage starts Claude Code as you
would yourself: with your environment, so an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` there, or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`, reaches Claude Code and decides how it signs in. The key saved in the plugin is not
given to Claude Code.

**What you need.** Either Claude Code, installed and signed in (Anthropic account with a subscription or API credit), or an Anthropic API key.
SlideMage 9.1 or later.

## Development

The plugin follows the [SlideMage plugin template](https://github.com/stpalan/slidemage-plugin-template) and the
[plugin conventions](https://slidemage.org/plugins/submit/). [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) has the steps and
[docs/Handover.md](docs/Handover.md) says where things stand.

```
claude/                  the plugin
  __init__.py            activate(host): two DRAFT routes, combined AI settings, hook entry point
  host.py                exact 3d host subset + DRAFT route/settings contracts
  credentials.py         host-owned Anthropic key + lazy legacy migration
  api/provider.py        the Anthropic API client (standard library only)
  code/                  Claude Code: launch, MCP server, hook, scope
  code/terminal/         the embedded terminal: session, view, unsent-prompt reader
tests/                   the plugin's tests
docs/                    plan, handover, and remaining integration gaps
```

**Status: step 6b is a DRAFT.** It uses the implemented AI host services, but route/AI-settings registration and
workspace integration still wait for SlideMage 3a/3b/3c. The unchanged `python3 build.py --check` reports 27 remaining
core imports, inventoried with their waits in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). This is not a release-ready plugin.

`python build.py --check` checks the plugin against the catalogue's conventions: `plugin.toml`, the package and its `activate(host)`, the imports, no
compiled files, and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the version. The **Check** workflow runs it on every push.

`python build.py` checks and then builds `dist/claude-<version>.smplugin` (a zip of `plugin.toml`, `LICENSE` and the package) and its `.sha256`.

### Tests

The tests need SlideMage on the path (its source for the imports, its `tests/` folder for the example project and the Qt fixtures, through
`tests/conftest.py`), using the `feature/ai-host-services` source worktree:

```
SLIDEMAGE_TESTS=../SlideMage/tests PYTHONPATH=../SlideMage/.worktrees/ai-host-services/src:. ../SlideMage/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

`SLIDEMAGE_TESTS` defaults to `../SlideMage/tests`.

### Releasing a version

1. Raise `version` in `plugin.toml` and add a line to the end of `CHANGELOG.md`:
   `v1.2.0 (2026-11-02, reason): What changed.`
2. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`.
3. The **Release** workflow checks that the tag matches the version, builds the asset and publishes the GitHub release with it.

A published version never changes: never replace or delete its asset; a fix is a new version.
