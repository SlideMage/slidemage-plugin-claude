# Claude plugin integration plan

The plugin targets SlideMage phase 7, `feature/ai-free-core` (PR #26), including its unreleased API 1 additions. Activation registers `anthropic_api`, `claude_code`, a shared AI settings section and the hook without creating widgets, reading keys, launching processes or using the network. The package imports only `slidemage.plugin_api` from SlideMage; `python3 build.py --check` enforces this.

Claude Code uses `chat_surface_v2`, the public chat context, terminal service, edit watch and process-aware cancellation token. The hook uses the public hook context for classification, snapshots and review records. The task and image backends use the public definitions and result types; task validation and both image prompt helpers receive `RouteContext` directly. Legacy Anthropic keys are read through the host or route context, with the saved/cleared marker preventing resurrection; saving a key notifies model pickers.

Route tasks, image batches and slide translation are started and leased by core. This plugin has no separate long-running settings job requiring `acquire_route_task` or progress reporting; its sign-in probe uses the ordinary background service. `legacy_ollama_host` is not relevant to the Claude routes. Phase 7 core registers no built-in AI routes, leaving ownership of the Claude IDs to this plugin.

The packaged plugin has no private SlideMage imports. Integration tests and the developer benchmark still import core internals to construct real application fixtures and compare behaviour; they are outside the package.

## Before 1.0.0

- Make the plugin repository public in the SlideMage organization and update its homepage as appropriate.
- Pin CI integration tests to a released SlideMage containing phase 7, and set the manifest's compatibility range to that release. The current `>=10.0` range does not establish compatibility with an unreleased API.
- Register the release in the SlideMage plugin catalogue.

## Needs a decision

- **Development-only imports:** removing private imports from integration tests and the benchmark would require replacing core-specific fixtures and benchmark functionality. Recommend retaining them until core supplies equivalent public test and benchmark interfaces; package imports already meet the strict checker.
