# Claude release history

v1.0.0 (2026-10-29, first release): Claude Code and the Anthropic API as SlideMage's cloud AI, as a plugin; they were part of SlideMage up to v9.0.

v1.0.1 (2026-10-29, website icon): The plugin has its own icon on the SlideMage website and in the plugin list, a cloud with an AI sparkle; the plugin itself is unchanged.

v1.0.2 (2026-10-30, hook on Windows): Claude Code no longer reports a failed UserPromptSubmit hook on Windows: the hook command now uses forward slashes in paths and double quotes, so Git Bash, which Claude Code runs it through, finds SlideMage.exe.

v1.0.3 (2026-10-30, SlideMage names): The hook finds the project with every SlideMage version: Claude Code gets the project folder as SLIDEMAGE_PROJECT, which SlideMage reads from v10 on, and as SLIDEMASTER_PROJECT for the versions before. The tests name the project variable through SlideMage and the bibliography SlideMage.bib.
